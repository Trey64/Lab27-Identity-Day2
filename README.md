## Identity Con't w/ Register and Login

- Took me 3 hours
- What did you struggle with? Why? How did you solve?
- I learned how to add a registration and login page, have the login be persistent, and create layout that indicates if a user is loggged in.
- Utilized the class demo, my previous lab, and the nest cam videos.
